# Retinal-OCT-classification
Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 3 Crore OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that renders an in vivo cross sectional view of the retina. OCT utilizes a concept known as inferometry to create a cross-sectional map of the retina that is accurate to within at least 10-15 microns

This project is concentrated towards classifying the OCT images into 4 types
1)Normal
2)Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
3)Diabetic macular edema(DME)
4)Drusen
